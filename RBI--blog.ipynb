    "Clustering algorithms are unsupervised process (learning) to group unlabeled data, based on the similarity of their features.\n",
    "**The k-Means clustering** algorithm is one of them being the well-documented and implemented in most machine-learning libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-Means clustering algorithm comes in several different implementations depending on the computational designs.\n",
    "We made our preference toward the **Mini-Batch k-Means** method.\n",
    "The main idea behind this algorithm is to use small random batches of data of a fixed size, so they can be stored in memory.\n",
    "Each iteration a new random batch from the dataset is obtained and used to update the clusters and this is repeated until convergence.\n",
    "Every data object in the batch is assigned to one of the clusters, depending on the previous locations of the cluster centroids.\n",
    "Updating the locations of cluster centroids is based on the new data object from the batch.\n",
    "The update is a gradient descent update, which is significantly faster than a regular batch k-Means update.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can evaluate the quality of our clusters using the evaluation metrics. \n",
    "The two of them have been called in this study. \n",
