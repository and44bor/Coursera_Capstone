    "In this project we explore the West End and East End of the *City of Toronto* in order to find attractive locations to open a few food venues that are members of different franchises though running by the same management company. \n",
    "Specifically, this report will cover business planning issues pertinent to the fast-food chain companies. \n",
    "The management companies like the **Restaurant Brands International Inc. (RBI)** show their  interest to this type of research analytics. Because it provides a scientific, grounded on data, approach to estimate attractive locations for their particular brand. \n",
    "\n",
    "The case description may look as it follows. \n",
    "The RBI which is a Canadian multinational fast-food holding company, owns  American fast-food restaurant chain  *Burger King* and Canadian coffee shop chain *Tim Hortons*. Relaying on marketing data, the management promotes opening a few franchisees in the \"Low Venue Density\" neighborhoods of Toronto that are predominantly located in the two boroughs, *Scarborough* (East End) and *Etobicoke* (West End) of the city.   \n",
    "The task is to locate particular neighborhoods having the high affinity to the fast-food venues. Then, identify those that are more suitable for opening a new *fast-food restaurant (Burger King)* and other for  opening a new *coffee shop (Tim Hortons)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use the Foursquare location data to create datasets of neighborhood popular venues. We explore a given borough and segment it with the pandas dataframe utilities and methods. The k-Means  Clustering  Method is run on the neighborhood--venue data and groups the neighborhoods based on similarity of their venue features. \n",
    "Then we use the Foursquare location data to create other datasets that include only targeted venue categories, as **fast-food restaurants (FFRs)** and **coffee shops (CSs)**, in operation. \n",
    "The frequency distribution in neighborhoods is calculated for each category. \n",
    "Results of analysis of two groups are merged, the franchise ratio is calculated in two ways, based on popularity and based on operation, and used to propose a list of particular locations suitable to open either a new FFR or CS.\n"

    "The k-Means clustering algorithm comes in several different implementations depending on the computational designs.\n",
    "We made our preference toward the **Mini-Batch k-Means** method.\n",
    "The main idea behind this algorithm is to use small random batches of data of a fixed size, so they can be stored in memory.\n",
    "Each iteration a new random batch from the dataset is obtained and used to update the clusters and this is repeated until convergence.\n",
    "Every data object in the batch is assigned to one of the clusters, depending on the previous locations of the cluster centroids.\n",
    "Updating the locations of cluster centroids is based on the new data object from the batch.\n",
    "The update is a gradient descent update, which is significantly faster than a regular batch k-Means update.\n",

    "We can evaluate the quality of our clusters using the evaluation metrics. \n",
    "The two of them have been called in this study. \n",
